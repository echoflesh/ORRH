# ORRH
A decentralised launcher designed to play abandoned versions of Roblox.
We achieve this by emulating dead/restricted website APIs and modifying the client executable.
This software comes with no liabilities. I don't care if you have a problem with the software.
I can't guarantee the safety of all the clients bundled.

# Features

- A simple black & white UI
- 19 clients ranging from 2007L to 2013L

- High quality screenshots for clients before 2013M
- 500+ built in accessories
- Launcher can be closed after launching the client
- Fullscreen fixes for older clients
- Settings do not interfere with modern Roblox settings
- IDE no longer crashes when you drag something
- Studio hosting for all clients
